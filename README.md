# Recursion-in-C-
To study and implement Recursion

# Aim

To study and implement the concept of recursion in C++, where a function calls itself directly or indirectly, in order to solve problems such as factorial calculation, Fibonacci series generation, and other divide-and-conquer algorithms.

# Theory

Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself either directly or indirectly to solve a problem. A recursive function solves a small part of the problem in each call and relies on the result of the subsequent recursive call to complete the solution.

Every recursive function has two essential components:

1. Base Case: A terminating condition that stops the recursion and prevents infinite function calls.

2. Recursive Case: The part of the function where it calls itself with a reduced or simpler version of the original problem.

In C++, recursion is commonly used in problems like factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, Tower of Hanoi, searching, and sorting algorithms (like quicksort and mergesort).

Advantages of recursion:

  * Simplifies complex problems.

  * Provides cleaner and shorter code.

Disadvantages of recursion:

  * May consume more memory due to repeated function calls.

  * Can be slower compared to iterative solutions in some cases.

# Procedure

1/ Write a recursive function with a base case.

2/ Call the function with input values.

3/ Trace how the function stack grows and reduces.

4/ Observe output and compare with iterative solution.

# Conclusion 

We successfully implemented recursion in C++. Recursive programs simplify problems like factorial and summation, but must always have a base case to prevent infinite recursion.
