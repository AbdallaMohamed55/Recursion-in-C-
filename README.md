# Recursion-in-C-
To study and implement Recursion

# Aim

To study and implement the concept of recursion in C++, where a function calls itself directly or indirectly, in order to solve problems such as factorial calculation, Fibonacci series generation, and other divide-and-conquer algorithms.

# Theory

Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly until a base condition is met.

  * Base case: Stops recursion.

  * Recursive case: Function calls itself with smaller input.
  Examples include factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, reversing numbers, etc.

# Procedure

1/ Write a recursive function with a base case.

2/ Call the function with input values.

3/ Trace how the function stack grows and reduces.

4/ Observe output and compare with iterative solution.

# Conclusion 

We successfully implemented recursion in C++. Recursive programs simplify problems like factorial and summation, but must always have a base case to prevent infinite recursion.
